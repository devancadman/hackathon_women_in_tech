        <p>Do you ever feel like a fraud? Are you living with chronic self-doubt? Do you question whether you
            deserve to be in your role? If so, you're not alone! As a leadership coach and lifelong struggler with
            impostor syndrome, I wanted to create a space where professionals can tell their personal stories and
            unburden themselves of the silent shame that comes with this experience. I also wanted listeners to be
            able to hear themselves in others and realize that they are not alone. On this podcast, we'll share the
            stories of professionals from different backgrounds who've struggled with and learned to manage impostor
            syndrome. We'll also learn from experts on how to better manage ourselves and our environments to
            minimize the overall threat of impostor syndrome. Let's erase the stigma and stop feeling ashamed of
            these very normal experiences. And let's come together to share our challenges and strategize how to
            effectively rise above them.

                <p>Acknowledge your thoughts.Impostor syndrome isn’t rational.
                    You can’t beat it with rational arguments.Name these thoughts. Write them down,
                    sit with them. Try to cut down on any rationalizations. The truth is you’re not really
                    a fraud, so there’s no way you can get “found out”.</p>
